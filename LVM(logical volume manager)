LVM is a tool for logical volume management which includes allocating disks, striping, mirroring and resizing logical volumes.
With LVM, a hard drive or set of hard drives is allocated to one or more physical volumes. LVM physical volumes can be placed on other block devices which might span two or more disks.
The physical volumes are combined into logical volumes, with the exception of the /boot partition. The /boot partition cannot be on a logical volume group because the boot loader cannot read it. If the root (/) partition is on a logical volume, create a separate /boot partition which is not a part of a volume group.
Since a physical volume cannot span over multiple drives, to span over more than one drive, create one or more physical volumes per drive.
Logical Volumes
Figure 11.1. Logical Volumes

The volume groups can be divided into logical volumes, which are assigned mount points, such as /home and / and file system types, such as ext2 or ext3. When "partitions" reach their full capacity, free space from the volume group can be added to the logical volume to increase the size of the partition. When a new hard drive is added to the system, it can be added to the volume group, and partitions that are logical volumes can be increased in size.

On the other hand, if a system is partitioned with the ext3 file system, the hard drive is divided into partitions of defined sizes. If a partition becomes full, it is not easy to expand the size of the partition. Even if the partition is moved to another hard drive, the original hard drive space has to be reallocated as a different partition or not used.
 
 
 1  apt-get update
    2  fdisk -l   -- to see how many volumes are there
    
    4  fdisk /dev/xvdb  --and entering  into new volume
    5  press - p - to see how many paritions are there
       press - n - to create the new partitions
       And again press - p for primary partitions
       And select the how many partitins do you want press 1
       And give the size of the disk in default line
       The volumes must be in LVM type so press t after that give the type code i.e 8e	 
       To save and write type wq
       	 
    8  partprobe /dev/xvdb  - to move to kernal os
    9  pvcreate /dev/xvdb1   - to create a primary partition
   10  pvs   - to see the primary partition type
   11  vgcreate VG0 /dev/xvdb1  -- to add into volume
   12  vgs  --- to see volume group type
   13  lvcreate -n lv0 -L +1G VG0  --- to create a logical volume type
   14  lvdisplay /dev/VG0/lv0  ---  to see full details of logical volumes
   15  mkfs.ext4 /dev/VG0/lv0   ---  format the volume
       mkdir /lv0    ----   to create the directory
   16  mount /dev/VG0/lv0 /lv0  ---- mount the volume
   17  df -h
   18  cd /lv0  to enter into volume
   19  touch nag
   20  ls
   21  cd ..
